<title>Advantageous Skills Assessment</title>
<h2> Advantageous Skill Assessment</h2>
<body>
<div>
<div>
	<p>
	In this course, you will use a variety of tools implemented in different programming languages to generate useful
	facts about a program’s behavior and analyze them.  You will learn about the tools and their theoretical underpinnings
	in this course, however it is assumed that you are already familiar with basic concepts in computer science and
	mathematics, as well as the use of various tools/commands in a UNIX-like environment.  

	</p><p>
	This assessment is designed to help you determine specific skills and concepts you should learn or refamiliarize
	yourself with prior to starting this course.  You do not need to master each and every one of these skills - but you
	should have command of the majority of them.  While it will be possible to pick up some of these skills along the way,
	it may prove difficult to cover them.

	</p><p>
	The instructors and teaching assistants have only a limited capability to assist students with learning these tasks,
	and they will not be explicitly covered in lectures.
  </p></div>
  <ul>
  <div>
     <li><h3>Navigating a UNIX-like Environment</h3>
	 All assignments in this class assume a UNIX-like environment. You should be comfortable browsing folders and
	 executing basic commands from a UNIX command prompt.

     <p><dfn>Sample task:</dfn>
	 Using just a command prompt in a UNIX-like environment (such as Linux or macOS), create a new folder, create a text
	 file inside that folder, and change the file permissions to allow execution of that file (such as would be needed if the
	 file contained a shell script). Finally, create a ZIP archive of your folder and extract it to a
	 different location to verify that it was correctly created.</p> </li>
  </div>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <div>
	<li><h3>Writing Shell Scripts</h3>

	 <p>For some assignments, you may need to write a shell script that can execute a command. You may use any common
	 UNIX shell scripting language such as bash, csh, or even python.</p>

     <p><dfn>Sample task:</dfn>
	 Write a script that can be executed with the command <code>./myscript.sh input.txt output.txt</code> that takes an
	 input text file and produces a version of the file that is sorted using the UNIX <code>sort</code> program. Your program
	 should produce an <code>output.txt</code> that contains just Error if the input causes sort to crash.</p> </li>
  </div>
</ul>	
<ul>
  <div>
    <li><h3>Evaluating Data Structures</h3>

	 <p>You should know how to perform analysis on common data structures such as trees, heaps, queues, and stacks. You should
	 be able to write code in Java and C++ that can use common data structures.</p>

     <p><dfn>Sample task:</dfn>
	 Using a high level language such as Java or C++, write a class that builds a balanced binary tree out of an
	 unsorted array of integer values. Then write a search function to determine if a specific value exists in the tree. Your
	 search function should use an algorithm such as a BFS (Breadth First Search) or DFS (Depth First Search) on the tree
	 values and return false if the desired value does not exist in the tree.</p>

	 <p>Sample input array of values: [26, 28, 76, 32, 4, 87, 42, 9, 12]</p></li>
  </div>
</ul>
<ul>	
  <div>
     <li><h3>Debugging High Level Code</h3>

	 <p>Some tools we explore in this class automatically generate test cases that will find bugs in a provided
	 application. You should be able to use a compile error or stack trace to figure out why a source file doesn’t compile.
	 Additionally, you should be able to find and fix issues such as null pointer exceptions or invalid cast errors in a code
	 file. As many applications we will be analyzing are relatively simple, we recommend having a high level of comfort
	 debugging simple issues without the help of an IDE.</p>

	 <p><dfn>Sample task:</dfn>
	 Run the following Java program. Make sure that all code in the main method executes to produce correct results.</p>

    <li><h3>Using Man Pages and Modifying Commands</h3>

	 <p>Many software analysis tools require more knowledge of the tool than will be provided in assignment instructions
	 to effectively use the tool. You should be comfortable reading the documentation that is provided with tools and
	 utilities. In particular, one great resource available for many tools are man pages. Most UNIX tools provide a man page
	 that gives basic usage instructions and how to modify the command to accomplish different tasks.</p>

     <p><dfn>Sample task:</dfn>
	 Use the <code>uniq</code> UNIX tool to take the following text (copy it into a text file) and remove duplicate lines.

	 </p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">		
	The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
	THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.
	The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.
	My quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
	His quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
	The quick, brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
	The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

	 </code></pre></figure>
	 <p></p>

     <p>Modify your command to do the following things:
	<ul style="list-style-type:square">
     </p><li>Prefix each line by the number of occurrences of that line in the file</li>
     <li>Skip comparing the first three characters on the line</li>
     <li>Ignore the case of the characters in the comparison</li>
	</ul>
     Hint: use the <code>man</code> command to figure out the capabilities of <code>uniq</code>.<p></p> </li>
  </div>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <div>
     <li><h3>Understanding of Random Distributions and Sampling</h3>

	 <p>Some of the analysis and testing techniques exploit the power of randomness.  While a thorough understanding of
	 probability and statistics is not necessary for success in this course, you should be familiar with the concepts of the
	 Random Distribution and Random Sampling.  You should be able to apply these concepts to randomized algorithms and reason
	 about the likelihood of a particular program behavior.</p>
	 
     <p><dfn>Sample task:</dfn>
	 Assume you are writing a program to randomly award a prize to contestants.  Contestants enter a 32-bit unsigned integer
	 at random. If the number entered is between 50 and 65 and divisible by 5, the contestant wins.  
	 </p><ol>
		<li>What is the likelihood that any given contestant will win?</li>
		<li>Assuming the program handles one contestant per minute, how long should we expect the game to run before a
		contestant wins?  Minutes, hours, days, weeks or months?</li>
		<li>If the contestant enters the string “WIN” instead of an integer, what is the likelihood that the contestant will
		win?</li>
     </ol><p></p></li>
  </div>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <div>
     <li><h3>Working Knowledge of Code Build Processes</h3>

	 <p>One of the topics of this course is Software Analysis. Software can be analyzed at various stages in its life cycle
	 including in its source code written by the programmer, an intermediate representation generated by a compiler or
	 language toolchain, and in the program’s binary representation.</p>

	 <p>While extensive knowledge of compilers, toolchains, and runtimes is not necessary for this course, in general
	 you should have a working knowledge of what happens to your code when you “build” it.</p>

     <p><dfn>Sample task:</dfn>
	 You should be able to answer the following questions regarding code build processes:
	 </p><ol>
		<li>What is the difference between high level code, intermediate representation, assembly code, and machine
		language?</li>
		<li>What is the difference between a compiled language and an interpreted language?</li>
		<li>What happens to C/C++ code when you click “Build and Run” in an IDE?</li>
		<li>What happens to Java code when you click “Build and Run” in an IDE?</li>
	</ol><p></p></li>

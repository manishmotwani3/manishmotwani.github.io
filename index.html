        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Hank Quinlan!</h1>
				<p>
				I am a PhD candidate pursuing research in Computer Science with specialization in Software Engineering.
				I work at LASER, College of Information and Computer Science, UMass Amherst with Dr. Yuriy Brun and 
				my current research focuses on the evaluation and advancement of Automated Program Repair techniques.
				Prior to this, I worked as researcher at the Requirements Engineering group (part of Software Engineering Lab) 
				led by Dr. Smita Ghaisas at TCS Research, Pune India.
				I am interested in improving software engineersâ€™ productivity by automating software engineering practices. 
				My research involves analyzing large software repositories to learn interesting phenomena, 
				and to use that knowledge to design novel automation techniques, such as requirements elicitation, testing, 
				and program repair.

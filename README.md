## 2. Prerequisites
- **Information**:
  - Each web page has its own directory containing all related files.
  - Pages use JSON files for content updates and dynamic rendering of information.
  - When you change a JSON it should auto update the website but if not try this into the terminal to help with the process: *chmod -R 777 /nfs/stak/users/motwanim/public_html/*

            "class": "research-project anchor-target",
            "title": "High-Quality Automatic Program Repair",
            "description": "Automatic program repair (APR) has recently gained attention because it proposes to fix software defects with no human intervention. To automatically fix defects, most APR tools use developer-written tests to (a) localize the defect, and (b) generate and validate the automatically produced candidate patches based on the constraints imposed by the tests. While APR tools can produce patches that appear to fix the defect for 11â€“19% of the defects in real-world software, most of the patches produced are not correct or acceptable to developers because they overfit to the tests used during the repair process. This problem is known as the patch overfitting problem. To address this problem, I propose to equip APR tools with additional constraints derived from natural-language software artifacts such as bug reports and requirements specifications that describe the bug and intended software behavior but are not typically used by APR tools. I hypothesize that patches produced by APR tools while using such additional constraints would be of higher quality. To test this hypothesis, I propose an automated and objective approach to evaluate the quality of patches, and propose two novel methods to improve the fault localization and developer-written test suites using natural-language software artifacts. Finally, I propose to use my patch evaluation methodology to analyze the effect of the improved fault localization and test suites on the quality of patches produced by APR tools for real-world defects.",

      4. Right click the Canvas Export Folder in the public_html directory and press Copy Path and paste it into the terminal.
      5. It will then ask ("Enter the content for header1: "). This will be the Course Number (CS 569, CS 563)
      6. It will then ask ("Enter the content for header2: "). This will be the Course Description (Selected Topics in Software Engineering: Program Analysis and Evaluation)
      7. Once the links are updated, the script will print out the path to the syllabus.html fo the course you just exported. For example: /~motwanim/courses/*exported course number*/syllabus.html
      8. Copy and paste this link into the "URL" entry above in the JSON format for a new Course Entry.

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to read and understand a recently published research paper and lead a discussion in the class by talking about:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>The problem addressed in the paper</li>
<li>Motivation behind solving that problem</li>
<li>Proposed solution and practical significance of the solution</li>
<li>Evaluation in terms of the research questions addressed</li>
<li>Novelty of the proposed solution considering state-of-the-art</li>
<li>Assumptions made </li>
<li>Limitations of the proposed solution</li>
</ol>
<p>After selecting your paper, you should thoroughly read the paper following the 3rd pass of the 3-pass approach we talked about, discuss it with your group members, and start working on preparing the presentation that covers the aforementioned points to lead the class discussion. <strong>You should get the feedback on your presentation during the in-class exercise on Monday 05/13/24</strong> and so, the sooner your start the more feedback you will get to make your final presentation better.  </p>
<p>In addition to describe the research paper, your presentation must talk about<strong> at least three discussion points</strong> for example, possible extensions of the proposed solution, assumptions that may not hold true in the future or are unrealistic, application of proposed conceptual approach to totally different research problem, etc. <strong>that are not described in the paper.</strong></p>
<p><br/><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Deliverable</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Each group should upload a</span> powerpoint or pdf format of the presentation slides you will use in your class presentation.<span> </span></p>

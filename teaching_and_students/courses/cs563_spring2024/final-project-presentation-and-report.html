<title>Assignment: Final Project Presentation and Report </title>
</head>
<body>
<p><span>Due:<strong> Wednesday, June 05, 2024, 11:59 AM PT</strong></span></p>
<p>This is a group assignment. Each project group is to submit one zip file containing a project report and presentation. The group will also present for<strong><span> 20</span> minutes</strong><span> </span>in class on<span> <strong>Wednesday, June 05, 2024</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Every member of the group is expected to put in equal effort. The entire group will share the same grade; however, if members identify others who have not contributed (or have contributed above and beyond), the grades can be varied accordingly.</p>
<p><span><strong>Late assignments will not be accepted without prior permission.</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
<p>The goal of the final report is to describe the work you completed as part of the class project. It should be a complete, self-contained document.</p>
<p>The final report (both the write up and the presentation) has to include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>A statement of the problem you solved (Abstract and Introduction).</li>
<li>Background and Motivation: Why is that problem important to solve and how your solution is practically significant.</li>
<li>Related Work: Placement of your problem and solution in the context of related research.</li>
<li>Approach: A detailed description of how you solved the problem. This should describe the technique and not the implementation. </li>
<li>Evaluation: Detailed description about dataset, evaluation metrics, experiment procedure, and results.</li>
<li>Discussion: Limitations, threats to validity of your solution based on the assumptions you made, and future research directions. </li>
<li>Conclusions</li>
</ol>
<p>It is expected that your final report will use significant text from your project idea and project plan submissions. You should, of course, address the comments you got on that text.<br/><br/></p>
<p><span><strong>Deliverables</strong></span></p>
<p>Each group should upload<span> </span><strong>1 zip file</strong><span> </span>(&lt;your-project-name&gt;_final.zip) via Canvas that contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>A .pdf of a single write up, per group <span>using </span><a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/dzcdmrfzxcpm#8024c4" target="_blank" title="Link"><span>this overleaf template</span></a><span>.</span> You should aim for roughly 10 pages, but I impose neither a minimum nor a maximum: You should write enough to describe and motivate your problem, place your work in terms of related research (for research-based project), and detail your solution, evaluation, and results.</li>
<li>A powerpoint or .pdf format of the presentation slides you will use in your class presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your report should not be written as a mystery novel. The sooner you describe your problem at a high level, and summarize your findings and your support for those findings, the better. You may include an abstract at the start of your report that accomplishes this job, or simply include this information in the first section.</strong></p>

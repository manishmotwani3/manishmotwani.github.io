<title>Assignment: Literature Review and Project Plan </title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Due:<span> </span><strong>Wednesday, May 8, 2024, 11:59 AM PT</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>This assignment will be completed individually or in teams of<span> </span><strong>up to 3 students.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>This is a group assignment. <strong>Each project group is to submit one paper and you should build on the project idea report that your wrote in the project idea proposal assignment. </strong>Every member of the group is expected to put in equal effort. The entire group will share the same grade; however, if members identify others who have not contributed (or have contributed above and beyond), the grades can be varied accordingly.  The group will also present for <strong>20 minutes</strong> in class on <strong>Wednesday, May 8, 2024</strong>.</p>
<p>This assignment requires you to do two main tasks: <strong>Literature review</strong> and <strong>Project planning</strong>. <strong>Please read the instructions described below carefully to understand what is expected to be done for both the tasks. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Literature Review</strong></h3>
<p>The goal of a literature review is to place your work in the context of other related literature and identify <strong>your</strong> project’s research contribution. After reading the literature review, the reader should understand the state of the art around your project topic, what related research questions have already been answered, and how the new research question(s) you will answer will advance the state of the art.</p>
<p>The purpose of a literature review <strong>is neither</strong> to create an original argument <strong>nor</strong> to support your position with scholarly research. Instead, a literature review places your work among the related work and identifies how your contribution is novel.</p>
<p>Literature reviews direct the formation of new research questions and are routinely included in the opening sections of scholarly research reports. You should write enough to describe the state of the art and how your work fits within it.  You should aim for discussing <strong>at least ten related papers,</strong> but every project is different.</p>
<h4><strong>What’s in the literature review?</strong></h4>
<p>Your updated project paper after doing the literature review should contain:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>An updated <strong>Introduction</strong> section with two to three paragraph statement of <strong>your research project.</strong> State the research question(s) you are trying to answer, and what methods you plan on using to answer it.  Assume the reader has never spoken to you, has not seen your earlier presentation, and has not read your idea proposal.</li>
<li>A <strong>Related Work</strong> section describing the summary of the related work as a whole. Tell us if there are multiple fields you will describe. For example, your work may be related to both defect prediction and fault localization. State the fields and (at a very high level) how they relate to your work.
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>For each field, describe if there are any subfields. For example, you may say that related automated bug removal literature can be classified into three types of approaches: heuristics-based, constraint-based, and learning-based approaches.</li>
<li>For each paper in each subfield, write one to two paragraphs describing (i) the research question that paper answers, (ii) the summary of the technique it uses, and (iii) how your work <strong>compares with and differs from</strong> that paper. For example, you may be answering a related but different research question, or you may be answering the same question but in a different setting (such as they answered it only for C and you are answering it for a broader set of languages).</li>
<li>Ensure you properly cite all the papers you discuss in your submission. You do not need to cite papers you look at but do not discuss in your literature review.</li>
<li>Use sections and subsections to organize your discussion of the fields and subfields.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>How to get started?</strong></h4>
<p>To get started, you should take a paper or two (Prof. Motwani can suggest a good starting point). Familiarize yourself with these papers and generate a list of potential related papers by (1) looking at the papers these papers cite, and (2) looking at other papers that cite these papers (you can find this information on <a class="inline_disabled" href="http://scholar.google.com" target="_blank">http://scholar.google.com</a> and <a class="inline_disabled" href="http://dl.acm.org" target="_blank">http://dl.acm.org</a>, among other places). You can also search for keywords related to your work. <strong>Your list should have at least 20 papers.</strong></p>
<p>Read the abstracts of the papers on your list. For some papers, you may have to dive a little deeper than the abstract, but do not spend too much time reading the entire paper, remember the three-pass approach. Your goal is to identify which of the papers are actually relevant enough to be included in your review. Discuss the papers and narrow down the list to the papers you will discuss.</p>
<p>Now, read each paper on this shorter list in more detail. It is possible that you will discover other papers these papers cite that may be relevant to add to your list. The goal is not to understand every detail of every paper, but rather to understand what these papers accomplish. <em><strong>You are not trying to understand so much that</strong></em><br/><em><strong>you can repeat this work; you just want to know what they did.</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Project Plan</strong></h3>
<p>The goal of a project plan is to lay out exactly what you will do for your class project. <strong>It is not a proposal.</strong> It is not a general idea of a problem you will work on. <strong>It is a write up of exactly the problem you will solve, how you will solve it, how you will evaluate your solutions, and what you expect to find. </strong>The perfect project plan is essentially your final report, except instead of "we did such and such" it is allowed to say "we will do such and such" and instead of "the experiment showed that" it is allowed to say "the experiment will show either this or that".  The final report will necessarily change some, as you carry out the work and discover issues and interesting problems you did not anticipate, but the smaller these changes are, the better.</p>
<h4><strong>What’s in the project plan?</strong></h4>
<p>The project plan has to include the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>An updated <strong>Introduction</strong> section with the research question(s) you will answer. In other words, what problem(s) are you solving?</li>
<li>The <strong>Motivation</strong> section describing why the research question(s) is(are) worth answering?</li>
<li>The <strong>Approach</strong> section describing how your solution will solve the problem(s). This should convince the reader that the solution will actually have a good chance at being successful.</li>
<li>The <strong>Evaluation</strong> section describing how will you evaluate your solution (e.g., what <strong>dataset</strong> and <strong>metrics</strong> will you use and how will you run your <strong>experiments</strong>). In other words, how will you prove, demonstrate, or argue that your solution solved the problem?</li>
</ol>
<p>While discussing your plan, you may find it useful to refer to related work. There is no need to repeat the text you write for your literature review. If you choose, you may refer to that section directly. For example, in your Approach section you could write "As outlined in our literature review~\ref{sec:relatedwork}, automated testing solutions suffer greatly from the lack of large quantum computers."</p>
<h4><strong>How to get started?</strong></h4>
<p>To get started, write down your research question and have the entire group discuss it until you agree that this is what you will solve. <strong>A research question is not a method or solution!  </strong>For example, “We will combine automated test generation and localization” is not a research question. It is not even a question. An example of a research question is “Can automated testing techniques generate tests to detect the kinds of bugs observed in real, open-source development?” Nailing down your research question first is critical to organizing the rest of your plan.</p>
<p>Once you settle what the research question is, write a <strong>motivation</strong> section around it. It is important to motivate why your research question has value. Good ways to do this is to describe a task developers have to do today, and why it is hard. Then explain how answering your research question would simplify performing this task. For example, today developers have to manually create tests for their software. If we knew that automated testing techniques can effectively detect bugs (or some class of bugs) that are representative of real bugs, the developers could reduce the amount of manual testing they’d have to do because they wouldn’t have to worry about writing tests for those types of bugs. Writing a before-and-after scenario can be helpful: describe the use case of what developers do today to accomplish something, and then what the developers will have to do after you are done with you work to accomplish the same task.</p>
<p>Next, focus on how you will know if you succeed. This is the evaluation part of the plan, which will likely come last in your write up. Figure out what you’ll need to demonstrate in order to know that you succeeded. For example, you might succeed if you show that at least 40% of the development versions of some open-source code that fail a test can be detected by taking a version of the same code that passes all the tests and using that version to generate a test suite with help of an state-of-the-art automated test generation technique. Think hard about your evaluation. What happens if something goes wrong? What if you can’t find enough open-source programs? Come up with a back up plan. Consider that the research question might be answered in the negative and explain how you’ll know if that’s the case.</p>
<p>Finally, describe your solution. This part of the plan (<strong>Approach</strong> section) will vary the most among the groups. Some will develop a tool. Some a new technique (that they may implement). Some only an evaluation framework. Describe your solution in enough detail to convince the reader that the solution will actually have a good chance of being successful.</p>
<p>Sections and subsections can help you organize your report and get your points across most effectively.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Deliverables</strong></h3>
<p>Each group should upload 1 zip file (&lt;project-name&gt;_&lt;last-name&gt;.zip) via Canvas that contains:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Submit a .pdf of a single write up, per group using <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/dzcdmrfzxcpm#8024c4" target="_blank" title="Link">this overleaf template</a>. There is no right length minimum or maximum: you should write enough to describe your problem, the state of the art and how your work fits within it, your solution, why your solution will succeed, and how you will evaluate your solution to know that it succeeded. Three pages<br/>is probably not enough to write a convincing argument, whereas more than seven pages probably means you are not being direct enough in your discussion. You should aim for discussing <strong>at least ten related papers,</strong> but every project is different.</li>
<li>Submit a powerpoint or .pdf format of the presentation slides you will use in your class presentation. <strong>Focus your presentation on the problem you are solving, and the data or experiments you will use and run.</strong></li>

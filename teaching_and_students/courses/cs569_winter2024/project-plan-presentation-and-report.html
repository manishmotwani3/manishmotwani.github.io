<title>Assignment: Project Plan Presentation and Report</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Due:<strong> Wednesday, Feb 14, 2024, 11:59 AM PT</strong></span></p>
<p>This is a group assignment. Each project group is to submit one project plan. The group will also present for<strong> 15 minutes</strong> in class on <strong>Wednesday, Feb 14, 2024</strong>.</p>
<p>Every member of the group is expected to put in equal effort. The entire group will share the same grade; however, if members identify others who have not contributed (or have contributed above and beyond), the grades can be varied accordingly. All the projects must use <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">https://trello.com/</a> to keep track of their project and create a private project repository on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">https://github.com/</a> for their project that should contain every artifact that you create for the project including, code, data, README files, presentations, and write ups.  All projects should add Manish (use email <a href="mailto:motwanim@oregonstate.edu" target="_blank">motwanim@oregonstate.edu</a>) to their Trello board and the Github repository (use <strong><em>manishmotwani3</em></strong>). Finally, make sure that all project members make incremental commits on whatever task they work on instead of a single commit pushing all the changes. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
<p>The goal of a project plan is to lay out <strong>exactly</strong> what you will do for your class project. <strong>It is not a proposal. </strong>It is not a general idea of a problem you will work on. It is a write up of exactly the problem you will solve, how you will solve it, how you will evaluate your solutions, and what you expect to find. The perfect project plan is essentially your final report, except instead of "we did such and such" it is allowed to say "we will do such and such" and instead of "the experiment showed that" it is allowed to say "the experiment will show either this or that". The final report will necessarily change some, as you carry out the work and discover issues and interesting problems you did not anticipate, but the smaller these changes are, the better.</p>
<p>The project plan (both, writeup and presentation) has to include the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>The research question(s) you will answer. In other words, what problem(s) are you solving? This should also include motivation for why this question is worth answering. For <strong><span>EleNa, </span></strong><span>you can just describe the motivation of the project.</span></li>
<li>How your solution will solve the problem(s). This should convince the reader that the solution will actually have a good chance at being successful. For <strong><span>EleNa, </span></strong>describe the algorithms you will implement and the rationale behind selecting them.</li>
<li>How will you evaluate your solution. In other words, how will you prove, demonstrate, or argue that your solution solved the problem? What dataset will you use? What metrics will you consider?</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Deliverables</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Each group should upload </span><strong>1 zip file</strong><span> (&lt;project-name&gt;_plan.zip) via Canvas that contains:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>A .pdf of a single write up, per group. There is no right length minimum or maximum: you should write enough to describe your problem, your solution, why your solution will succeed, and how you will evaluate your solution to know that it succeeded. Just as with the literature review, three pages<br/>is probably not enough to write a convincing argument, whereas more than six pages probably means you are not being direct enough in your discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>A powerpoint, or pdf format of the presentation slides you will use in your class presentation. <strong>Focus your presentation on the problem you are solving, and the data or experiments you will use and run. <br/><br/><br/></strong><strong>SUBMISSIONS: </strong><strong></strong></p>

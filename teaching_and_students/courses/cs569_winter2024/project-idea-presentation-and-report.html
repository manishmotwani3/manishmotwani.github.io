<title>Assignment: Project Idea Presentation and Report</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Due: <strong>Monday, Jan 29, 2024, 11:59 AM PT</strong><strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Projects will be completed in teams of <strong>up to 5 students</strong>. Each team is responsible for a single project.</li>
<li>You should select a team by adding yourself to one of the "Project" groups at <a href="$CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE$/groups#tab-110070" target="_blank">$CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE$/groups#tab-110070</a> by <strong>Wednesday, Jan 17, 2024, 11:59 PM PT</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This assignment consists of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Selecting a topic for your project.</li>
<li>Preparing a write-up describing your<span> project idea, your proposed solution (s), how you will evaluate your solutions to know that it succeeded, and the planned timeline and each group members' responsibilities.</span></li>
<li>Preparing a <strong>10-min</strong> presentation on your selected topic to be presented during the class time on <strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Monday, Jan 29, 2024</strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">.<br/> </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Your primary job in this assignment is two-fold:</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To describe your proposed project goal so that people understand what it is and why it is valuable. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To describe how you will accomplish your goal and how you will evaluate it so that it is clear how a team of up to five students can accomplish the goal in approximately 5 weeks. <br/><br/></span></li>
</ol>
<p>There are four options for a final project (each team will do one):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>MSR 2024 Mining Challenge</li>
<li>Replication study</li>
<li>EleNa: Elevation-based Navigation</li>
<li>Self-defined software engineering research project<br/><br/></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>MSR 2024 Mining Challenge</strong></span></p>
<p>The Mining Software Repositories conference runs an annual challenge in which they provide a dataset and ask you to answer research questions about the dataset. Read the description of this year’s dataset, research questions, and challenge here: </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Replication study</span></strong></p>
<p>A replication study takes an existing research paper, replicates its experiments on the same data, and then <strong>extends the experiments to expanding that data set on which the experiments are run.</strong> For this project, we highly recommend selecting a paper with publicly available dataset and code to execute the experiments. The project involves a write up describing the process of replicating the experiments, deviations in the achieved results from the original ones reported in the paper, and <strong>lessons learned from applying the experiments to new data</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a list of several papers that are good candidates for replication:</p>

</ol>
<p>You can also select a recently published paper of your choice that is not in the above list provided it is relevant to the course topics. </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">EleNa: Elevation-based Navigation</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Navigation systems optimize for the shortest or fastest route. However, they do not consider elevation gain. Let’s say you are hiking or biking from one location to another. You may want to literally go the extra mile if that saves you a couple thousand feet in elevation gain. Likewise, you may want to maximize elevation gain if you are looking for an intense yet time-constrained workout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The high-level goal of this project is to develop a software system that determines, given a start and an end location, a route that maximizes or minimizes elevation gain, while limiting the total distance between the two locations to x% of the shortest path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Components:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Your software system will most likely have five main components:</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Data model that represents the geodata.</span></li>
<li>A component that populates the data model, querying, e.g., OpenStreetMap.</li>
<li>The actual routing algorithm that performs the multi-objective optimization.</li>
<li>A component that outputs or renders the computed route.</li>
</ol>
<p>While all the  components are necessary for a working prototype, you may choose to focus on some of them in greater detail. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you focus on developing and experimenting with several routing algorithms, it is sufficient to have a simple interface for entering the start and end location and a simple output that represents the route.</li>
<li>If you focus on a sophisticated UI with proper rendering of the computed route, it is sufficient to have a basic data model and routing algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>While developing your application, you also need to create a comprehensive test-suite consisting of unit tests, integration tests, and system tests to verify different aspects of your implementation. </strong> Try using automated test generation techniques to generate tests. </p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Self-defined software engineering research project</span></strong></p>
<p>As the title suggests, this is an open-ended option for student groups who can define and execute their own research project related to software testing and analysis.</p>
<p>Finding a good research project requires reading research papers and thinking of an extension. You could look at the papers published at the latest premier software engineering conferences, e.g.,</p>
<ul>
<li>ICSE 2023: <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2023/icse-2023-technical-track?#event-overview" target="_blank">https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2023/icse-2023-technical-track?#event-overview</a> </li>
<li>ESEC/FSE 2023: <a href="https://2023.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2023-research-papers?#event-overview" target="_blank">https://2023.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2023-research-papers?#event-overview</a> </li>
<li>ISSTA 2023: <a href="https://2023.issta.org/track/issta-2023-technical-papers#event-overview" target="_blank">https://2023.issta.org/track/issta-2023-technical-papers#event-overview</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>and either replicate one of those papers’ experiments on another dataset, or extend either a technique or the evaluation described in a paper.</p>
<p>This project is appropriate for students already with some research experience.</p>
<p>Following are some sample research ideas and to discuss your idea, you can contact Manish via email.</p>
<p><strong>Sample project ideas:</strong></p>
<p>These ideas are meant as starting points. Students are encouraged to generate their own ideas, or to start from these high-level topics and generate a more concrete idea as a course project.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generating tests from natural language descriptions.<br/></strong>Software projects are more than just code. There are tests, requirements documents, bug reports, etc. Many of these documents are written in natural language. At the same time, projects’ test suites are often incomplete and fail to capture some notions described in these natural-language documents. This project focuses on the problem of generating executable tests from natural-language descriptions of code. See "<em>C2S: Translating natural language comments to formal program specifications</em>” (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3368089.3409716" target="_blank">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3368089.3409716</a>) as a starting point. One could consider applying recent large-language-model-based code generation tools (see CoPilot, Codex, GPT-J, GPT-Neo, GPT-NeoX-20B, and CodeParrot; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13169" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13169</a>) for test generation. Once one has tests, they could evaluate if the tests improve the quality of the existing test suite via coverage or mutation testing. </li>
<li><strong>Verification-guided sound refactoring.</strong><br/>Suppose you have a program and you want to refactor it to have it do the same thing but be simpler, more maintainable, etc. Create lots of mutants of the program. Identify ones that improve some useful metrics (filter out the rest). Run either an existing or a generated test suite to filter out mutants that do not behave the same way as the original program. Take the mutants that are left and (maybe automatically) use symbolic execution to verify that they are equivalent to the original program (e.g., use the Z3 theorem prover). Suggest the equivalent mutants that improve code metrics as sound refactorings that improve the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to email Manish to discuss your project ideas.</p>

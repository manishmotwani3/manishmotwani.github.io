<title>Assignment: Paper Review</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><span>Due: </span><strong>Wednesday Mar 6, 2024, 11:59 PM</strong></p>
<p>This is a group assignment. Each paper presentation group is to submit one writeup. The writeup should consider the discussions about the paper presented on Canvas and Q/A after the paper presentation during class time.</p>
<p>Every member of the group is expected to put in equal effort. The entire group will share the same grade; however, if members identify others who have not contributed (or have contributed above and beyond), the grades can be varied accordingly.</p>
<p><span><strong>Late assignments will not be accepted without prior permission.</strong></span></p>
